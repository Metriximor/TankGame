## Level 4 (Border/Trenches)
The fourth level is a network of trenches on each side with a no-mans-land area in between. Its quite early in the war and no-mans-land isnt yet only mud! so there is pleasant grass, flowers and trees around the craters. :relieved: 
While some tanks may have trouble crossing over the trenches there are bridges to help.
